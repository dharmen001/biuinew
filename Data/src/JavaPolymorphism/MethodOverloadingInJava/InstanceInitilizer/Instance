Instance initializer block

Instance Initializer block is used to initialize the instance data member.
It run each time when object of the class is created.
The initialization of the instance variable can be directly
but there can be performed extra operations while initializing
the instance variable in the instance initializer block.

Why use instance initializer block?
suppose i have to perform some operation while assigning value to instance data member e.g. a for loop
to fill a complex array or error hanling etc.

There are three places in java where you can perform operations.

1. Method
2. Constructor
3. block

Rules for instance initilizer block:

1. Instance initilizer block is created when instance of the class is created.
2. The instance initilizer block is invoked after the parent class constructor is invoked(i.e after
super() constructor call).
3. The instance initilizer block comes in the order in which they appear.
