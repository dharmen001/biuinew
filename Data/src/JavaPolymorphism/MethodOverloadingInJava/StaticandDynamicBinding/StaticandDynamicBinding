Connecting a method call to the method body is known as binding.

There are two types of binding

1. static binding(also known as early binding)
2. dynamic binding(also known as late binding)

Understanding type

lets understand the type of instance.

1) Variable have a type

Each variable has a type, it may be primtive and non-primtive.

int data = 30;

2) Refrence have a type

class dog {

public static void main(String [] args){

Dog d1;//Here d1 is a type of Dog

}

3.Object have a type

An object is an instance of particular java class, but it is also an
instance of its superclass

class Animal{

}

class Dog extends Animal
{
   public  static void main(String [] args)

   Dog d1 = new Animal();

}


Static Binding:

When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler)
it is know as static binding. if there is any private, static method in a class
, there is a static binding.
