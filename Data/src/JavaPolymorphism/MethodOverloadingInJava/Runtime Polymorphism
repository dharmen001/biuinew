Polymorphism in java is a concept by which we can perform a single action by different ways.
polymorphism is a derived from 2 geek words.

poly and morphs. The word poly means many and morphs means forms. so polymorphism means many forms.

there are two types of polymorphism in java: compile time polymorphism and run time polymorphism. we can
perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.


if you overload static method in java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism. Here, we will
focus on runtime polymorphism in java.

Runtime polymorphism in java:

Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic method dispatch is a process in which a call to an overriden method is resolved
at runtime rather than compile time.

in this process, an overriden method is called through the refrence variable of a superclass. The determination of the method
to be called is based on the object being referred to by the refrence variable.

upcasting:

When refrence variable of parent class refers to the object of child class, it is known as upcasting.

For example.

refrence variable of parent class>>>>>object of child class

class A{

}

class B extends A{}

A a = new B () //Upcasting
