A class that is declared with abstract keyword, is known as abstract class in java, it can have abstract and non-abstract methods(method with body).

Abstraction in java

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

it shows only important things to the user and hides the internal details for example sending sms, you just type the text and send the message.

don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.

Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

1. abstract class(0to 100%)
2. Interface(100%)

Abstract class in Java:

A class that is declared as abstract is known as abstract class. it needs to be extended and its method implemented. it cannot be instantiated.

Abstract class{}A

Abstract method

A method that is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as abstract method.

Example abstract method:

Abstract void printStatus()// no body and abstract

Understanding the real scenario of abstract class

In this example, Shape is the abstract class, its implementation is provided by the rectangle and circle class. Mostly we don't know about the implentation
class(i.e hidden to the end user) and object of the implementation class is provided by the factory method.

A factory method is the method that returns the instance of the class.
