1.inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and
behaviour of parent object.
2. the idea behind inheritance is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing
classes,when you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of parent class, and you can
add new methods and fields also.
