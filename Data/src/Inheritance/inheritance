1.inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and
behaviour of parent object.
2. the idea behind inheritance is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing
classes,when you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of parent class, and you can
add new methods and fields also.
3.Inheritance reprents the is-a relationship, also known as parent child relationship.

why use inheritance in java.

a. For method overriding(so runtime polymorphism can be achieved)
b. for code reusability.


Syntax of java inheritance.

class subclass-name extends superclass-name

{

//methods and fields
}

The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class.
The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.

in the terminology of java, a class which is inherited is called parent class or super class and the new
class is called child class or subclass.


Types of inheritance

On the basis of java, there can be three types of inheritance in java: single, multilevel and hierarchical

In java programming, multiple and hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only. Discuss later.
