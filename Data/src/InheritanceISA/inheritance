1.inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and
behaviour of parent object.
2. the idea behind inheritance is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing
classes,when you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of parent class, and you can
add new methods and fields also.
3.InheritanceISA reprents the is-a relationship, also known as parent child relationship.

why use inheritance in java.

a. For method overriding(so runtime polymorphism can be achieved)
b. for code reusability.


Syntax of java inheritance.

class subclass-name extends superclass-name

{

//methods and fields
}

The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class.
The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.

in the terminology of java, a class which is inherited is called parent class or super class and the new
class is called child class or subclass.

Public and Protected can be accessible in child class however private is not accessible.


Aggregation InheritanceISA.


If a class have an entity refrence, it is known as aggregation. Aggregation represents HAS-A relationship.

Consider a situtation, Employee object contains many information such as id,name, emailId etc. it contains one more object
named address, which contains its own information such as, city, country, zipcode etc. as given below.


Aggregation used for code reusablility.
