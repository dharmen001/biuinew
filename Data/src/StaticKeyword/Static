Java static keyword.

The Static Keyword in java is used for memory management mainly. we can apply java static keyword with variable, methods, blocks and nested class.
The static keyword belongs to the class than instance of the class.

The static can be:
1. Variable(also known as class variable)
2. method(also known as class method)
3. block
4. nested class


Java static variable

Any variable declare static, it is known as static.
1. The static variable can be used to refer the common property of all object(that is not unique for each object) e.g. company
name of employees, college name of students.

2. The static variable gets memory only once in class area at the time of class loading.


Advanatge of static variable is, it saves memory.

Java Static Method:

if you apply static keyword with any method, it is known as static method.

a. A static method belongs to the class rather than object of a class.
b. A static method can be invoked without the need for creating a instance of a class.
c. static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

1.You can not use non static method or data member in static method
2.this and super can not be use with super.

Why java main method is static?

1. Beacuse object is not required to call static method if it were non-static method, jvm create object
first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory allocation.

Java Static Block.

1. Is used to initilize the static data member.
2. it is excuted before main method at the time of classloading.
